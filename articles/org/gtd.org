* Thinking of doing GTD in org mode.
  I have been thinking of doing GTD for a long time, My current setup is miserable i tend to do only 
  things when someone is paining me or pointing a gun at my head. I realize that running to many threads
  in your head is just the worst thing you can do to yourself.

  Thus the best possible thing is to get organized. I knew about GTD for a long time but the best possible
  way to do GTD comes only with an understanding of how it works. Tools follow later i.e org-mode.

  Will Publish more on my setup in days to come when i perfect the technique.
