Self dot send is a computing blog focused on programming languages, software
design, data structures, systems programming, and applied AI topics such as
large language models and speech recognition. [[https://selfdotsend.com][selfdotsend.com]]

It publishes hands-on tutorials, including editor internals like gap buffers,
and practical notes on Unix tooling, ARM assembly, and day-to-day engineering

This blog is powered by AOG (Act of Genius), an Emacs Org-mode static
publishing system customized with the metacritical/selfdotsend theme.
[[https://github.com/metacritical/AOG][AOG on GitHub]]

Posts are written in Org files and published through an editor-first workflow,
so technical content can be iterated quickly without leaving Emacs.

It is deployed on GitHub Pages and reflects a strong preference for open-source
tooling, version-controlled content, and reproducible publishing.
