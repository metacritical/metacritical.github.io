                <p>
Since the time i learnt emacs i have toyed with the idea of writing my own programming
text editor. My fellow programmers often speculated that it is the most difficult 
endeavour one can undertake as a programmer, the arguments that were made included 
look at emacs and vim they have been here for over 3 decades and the devlopment is 
still active. 
</p>

<p>
And perhaps they are right. Despite these editors being touted as highly configurable
or programmable, Programmers regularly dive into the <code>C</code> code to upgrade them. 
It is infact a delicate exercise in the balance of power, between the <i>C-Runtime</i>
and the scripting language.
</p>

<p>
The obvious question is how much power should an user have in a programmable
editor? Clearly the existing power isnt enough some editors lend more power to 
the user than others. Emacs for instance is still undergoing active development 
in <i>C-Runtime</i>, instead of fixing the issues or adding enhancements at the <b>elisp</b> 
level (The scripting language of emacs).
</p>

<p>
Perhaps <code>elisp</code> isnt powerful enough or the <i>C-Runtime</i> is dominant and doesnt lend 
enough power to <code>elisp</code>. Either way the user ends up with power a deficiency.
</p>

<p>
<b>I wondered what percentage of emacs is written in elisp and how much in C?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>What about vim how much of vim is written in C and vimscript?</b>

<li><b>How do these existing Editors work?</b></li>
<li><b>Is there an efficiency equation that we are unaware of?</b></li>

<p>
Whenever i encounter complicated questions such as these, i remind myself of the 
famous Feynman quote.
</p>

<p class="verse">
What i cannot create i do not understand.<br />
- Richard Feynman<br />
</p>


<p>
Thought one thing is for sure, the documentation of emacs at <code>16.2%</code> is quite impressive
irrespective of the power level.
</p>

<p>
<code>Vimscript</code> may verywell be suited for extending the editor in small ways it but
sure is no match for a full fledged programming language, which means it too is 
heavily tied to the <i>C-Runtime</i> in vim, and even if the <i>C-Runtime</i> lends all the 
power that one seeks to this language, it is an ungly language to write code in.
</p>

<p>
I think what one needs is a language that is powerful enough to be both a general
purpose programming language and simple enough to be an extension language. Emacs
lisp fits that bill being a lisp, though elisp has borrowed power and can move only
so much as the runtime itself.
</p>

<p>
What if emacs was written in <b>100%</b> <code>elisp</code>? What if we write an Editor in a lisp
or scheme which gives us the power to extend the editor in the same language as the
editor itself written in.
</p>

<p>
A thought worthy of exploration! In the next few assays we would explore this idea
further to lend <b>100%</b> power to the user. We would explore concepts as broad wide 
as terminal buffers to datasctructures required to build an editor. We would piece
together an editor for ourselves in the next few assays, to know the answer to the
questions mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
Watchout for the next part of the assay till then.
