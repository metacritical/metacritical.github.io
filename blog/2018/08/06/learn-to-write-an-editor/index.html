                <p>
Since the time i learnt emacs i have always toyed with the idea of writing my own
programming text editor. My fellow programmers often speculated that it is the
most difficult endeavour one can undertake as a programmer, the arguments that were
made included look at emacs and vim they have been here for over 3 decades and the
devlopment is still active. 
</p>

<p>
Despite these editors being touted as highly configurable or programmable. This led
me to think how much power should a programmer have in a programmable editor? 
Is the existing programmable power not enough in the existing editors?. Emacs for
instance is still undergoing development instead of fixing the issues in elisp 
(The scripting language of emacs) or adding enhancements in elisp alone, without
going down to the C codebase in emacs. 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps elisp isnt powerful enough or emacs is too tied to the C runtime on which
elisp is written that elisp can have only so much power as the C runtime lends it. 
I wondered what percentage of emacs is written in elisp and how much in C.
I wondered what about vim? A quick look at vimscript and i was convinced that
vimscript is an half baked and obnoxious extensions language that has no respect
for any language semantics or conventions.
</p>

<p>
Though vimscript maybe verywell suited for extending the editor in small ways it 
sure is no match for a full fledged programming language it too is heavily tied to
the C runtime in vim, and even if teh C runtime lend all the power that one seeks
it still is an ungly language to write code in.
</p>

<p>
I think what one needs is a language that is powerful enough to be both a general
purpose programming language and simple enough to be an extension language. Emacs
lisp fits that bill being a lisp, though elisp has borrowed power and can move only
so much as the runtime itself. What if emacs was written in elisp? What if we write
and Editor in of these lisps or scheme which gives us the power to extend the editor
in the same language as the editor itself is build on.
